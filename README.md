# Iconocolor

An all-in-one Obsidian plugin for customizing folder icons, icon colors, and folder colors in the file explorer with powerful color transformation and inheritance systems.

## Features

- 🎨 **Folder Icons**: Add custom icons (SVG, PNG, or URLs) to any folder
- 🔍 **Icon Search**: Search and preview icons from Lucide (Obsidian's built-in icon library)
- 🌈 **Color Palettes**: Create and manage color palettes for automatic color assignment
- 🎯 **Auto-Coloring**: Automatically assign colors from palettes to root folders
- 🔄 **Color Transformations**: Derive icon, folder, and text colors from base colors using HSL or lightness adjustments
- 🌊 **Child Color Inheritance**: Child folders automatically inherit and transform colors from parent folders
- 📐 **Gradient Mode**: Smooth color interpolation between sibling folders
- 💾 **Profiles**: Save and switch between different color schemes and transformations
- 📋 **Default Icon Rules**: Automatically apply icons based on folder/file name patterns
- ⚙️ **Easy Configuration**: Right-click any folder to configure it, or use the settings panel

## Usage

### Setting Icons and Colors for a Folder

1. Right-click on any folder in the file explorer
2. Select **"Set Icon and Colors"**
3. In the Icon/Color Modal:
   - Search and browse built-in Lucide icons or added icon packs
   - Icons are displayed with live previews as you search
4. In the color picker:
   - Set a **base color** (the foundation color for this folder)
   - Optionally set explicit icon, folder background, or text colors (these override transformations)
   - Choose whether child folders should inherit the base color
5. Click **Apply**

### Managing Configurations

- View all configured folders in **Settings → Iconocolor**
- Edit or remove configurations from the settings tab
- Right-click a configured folder and select **"Remove icon and colors"** to clear its configuration

### Color Palettes and Auto-Coloring

1. Go to **Settings → Iconocolor → Color palettes**
2. Create or edit color palettes (collections of colors with consistent lightness)
3. Enable **Auto-color root folders** to automatically assign palette colors to root folders
4. Choose between **Gradient** (smooth color transitions) or **Repeat** (cycle through colors) mode

### Profiles

Save and switch between different color schemes:

1. Configure your desired settings (transformations, palettes, etc.)
2. Go to **Settings → Iconocolor → Profiles**
3. Click **Create profile** and give it a name
4. Switch between profiles anytime to instantly apply different color schemes

## Understanding Color Transformations

Iconocolor uses a powerful two-level color transformation system:

### Base Color

Every folder has a **base color** - the fundamental color that serves as the foundation. This can be:
- Set explicitly for a folder
- Inherited from a parent folder (if enabled)
- Automatically assigned from a color palette (for root folders)

### Base Transformations (Icon, Folder, Text Colors)

Base transformations determine how the **icon color**, **folder background color**, and **text color** are derived from the base color. These are global settings that apply to all folders.

**Transformation Types:**
- **None**: Use the base color directly
- **Lightness adjustment**: Make the color lighter or darker by a percentage (e.g., +20% lighter, -15% darker)
- **HSL transformation**: Adjust hue, saturation, and lightness independently

**Example:**
- Base color: `#3B82F6` (blue)
- Icon transformation: `None` → Icon is blue
- Folder transformation: `Lightness -15%` → Folder background is darker blue
- Text transformation: `Lightness +30%` → Text is lighter blue for contrast

### Child Base Transformation (Inheritance)

Child base transformation controls how child folders get their base color from parent folders. This creates a hierarchical color system.

**Transformation Types:**
- **None**: Children don't inherit colors (each folder is independent)
- **Lightness adjustment**: Each child's base color is adjusted from its parent's base color (cumulative - each level gets progressively lighter/darker)
- **HSL transformation**: Each child's base color is transformed using HSL adjustments (cumulative)

**Gradient Mode:**
When enabled, child folders interpolate between the parent's base color and the next sibling's base color before applying the transformation. This creates smooth color gradients across sibling folders.

**Example with Lightness Adjustment:**
```
Root folder: Base = #3B82F6 (blue)
  ├─ Child 1: Base = #5B9FF6 (10% lighter)
  │   ├─ Grandchild 1: Base = #7BBFF6 (10% lighter than child, 20% lighter than root)
  │   └─ Grandchild 2: Base = #9DDFF6 (10% lighter than child, 20% lighter than root)
  └─ Child 2: Base = #5B9FF6 (10% lighter)
```

**Example with Gradient Mode:**
```
Root folder: Base = #3B82F6 (blue)
Next sibling: Base = #EC4899 (pink)
  ├─ Child 1: Base = interpolated between blue and pink (step 1), then transformed
  ├─ Child 2: Base = interpolated between blue and pink (step 2), then transformed
  └─ Child 3: Base = interpolated between blue and pink (step 3), then transformed
```

The gradient automatically distributes across all children, creating smooth color transitions.

## Icon Sources

The plugin supports multiple icon sources:

### Built-in Icon Libraries
- **Lucide Icons**: Built into Obsidian, no download required. Includes hundreds of icons like folder, file, home, settings, etc.

### Custom Icons
- **SVG files**: Best for icons as they can be colored easily
- **PNG/JPG files**: Supported but colorization may be limited
- **URLs**: Any web-accessible image URL
- **Local paths**: Paths relative to your vault or absolute paths

## Color Formats

All colors should be in hex format:
- `#FF0000` (red)
- `#00FF00` (green)
- `#0000FF` (blue)
- `#FFFFFF` (white)
- etc.

## Development

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will watch for changes and automatically rebuild the plugin.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## How It Works

The plugin uses a sophisticated color system:

1. **Base Color Assignment**: Each folder gets a base color (explicit, inherited, or from palette)
2. **Color Transformations**: Base transformations derive icon, folder, and text colors from the base color
3. **Child Inheritance**: Child folders inherit and transform their parent's base color using child base transformations
4. **DOM Observation**: The plugin observes the file explorer DOM and applies styles in real-time
5. **Configuration Storage**: All settings are stored in the plugin's data file

The transformation system allows you to:
- Create cohesive color schemes across your folder structure
- Automatically generate contrasting colors for readability
- Build visual hierarchies through cumulative color transformations
- Experiment with different color schemes using profiles
